Note:  I have CAPSLOCK remapped as `ctrl-alt-command-shift`.  In order to remap Tmux's prefix key to my `CAPSLOCK-F`, open up iTerm2, go to Keys, and add a Global Keyboard Shortcut that will be triggered by `CAPSLOCK`+`F`.  Select "send a hex code" and send 0x02, which is the hex code for `CTRL-B` (which is Tmux's default prefix key).
